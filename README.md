# MapBox GL Native SDK Open-Source Fork

For iOS and Android 

MapLibre GL Native is a community led fork derived from [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) prior to their switch to a non-OSS license. The fork also includes Maps SDK for iOS and MacOS (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-ios](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios)) and Android SDK (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-android](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-android)).
