[MapLibre GL Native](https://github.com/maptiler/maplibre-gl-native) is a community led fork derived from [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) prior to their switch to a non-OSS license. The fork also includes Maps SDK for iOS and macOS (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-ios](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios)) and Android SDK (forked from [mapbox-gl-native-android](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-android)).

## Add MapLibre to your Project

To add a package dependency to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter its repository URL. See [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)

## Swift Packages Development

You can override the MapLibre package dependency and edit its content by adding it as a local package.  See [Editing a Package Dependency as a Local Package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/editing_a_package_dependency_as_a_local_package).

You can add this to `Package.swift`

```swift
.binaryTarget(
  name: "Mapbox",
  path: "build/output/Mapbox.xcframework"),
```
